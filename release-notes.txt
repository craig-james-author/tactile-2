  - Added these release notes
  - This is a major release that adds vibration controls, per-track
    configuration of all options, and the new Tactile Configurator.
  - Bug fix: "random" track playing wasn't really very random.
  - Bug fix: if a track reached the end while the sensor was still
    touched, it wouldn't start again on subsequent touches.
